Advanced Road Tools (ART)
---
##### Advanced Road Tools (ART) is a mod that provides a variety of tools to control roads and their behavior.

## Features
- **Zoning Controller Tool** — Control zoning on roads, with a previewable tool where you can hover the
  road and see what you'll get! Right-Click inverts the current zoning configuration

### Planned Features
- **Parallel Tool** — Create parallel roads and tracks out of any network. This tool will allow you to create
  parallel roads out of train tracks, highways and tram tracks without the need to trace them. Click them
  and see the new parallel road appear.
- **Advanced Grid Tool** — Create a grid by the number of columns and rows that you want. Set 2 control
  points to define a rectangle, and then, in a pop-up window, set how many rows and columns you want and them
  confirm it. voilà!
- **Control Zoning Depth** — Set zoning depth from 0 to 12 (or even more). Have EVEN MORE control over how
  zoning is generated on your roads. create a 2-deep zoning road for those nice warehouses, or 3-deep zoning road
  for those compact row homes. Or even, in the future, 12 deep zoning for 12x12 gigantic factories or mansions!
